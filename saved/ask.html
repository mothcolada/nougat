    <div class="ask">
        <p>Did you ever find the high percentage of trans women in your fan base surprising? As a somewhat active member of the community and a trans woman myself, I always find it funny (and nice!) that like, 90% of fans I've seen have been fellow trans women.. like.. woah.. this community has more dolls than Spice.. who is also a doll so this joke really came full circle huh hehe</p>

    <div class="response">
        <p>demigirl/transfemme solidarity... when i did my <a href="https://itch.io/blog/467672/the-results-are-in-survey-analysis-time" target="_blank">demographic survey</a> in 2022 i was more surprised that over half of responses used he/him, but it was a multi-select so probably a lot of mixed pronoun use in there. (omg 69% self-identified LGBT, i forgot about that...)</p>
        <p>i wanna do another survey again, it was fun. i get a lot of "your game helped me figure out my gender!" type messages, when i talked to a friend about it she said my characters are very like, warm and accepting of each other and just get to present however they like. i imagine that is the main appeal when you come from a world that isn't like that at all.</p>

      Lyn asked:</div>
    <div class="ask">
        <p>Do you believe that Lucchini is SEVERELY misunderstood?</p>
    </div></div>

    <div class="response">
        <p>i don't actually know what the lucchini discourse is like, but i remember reading someone's thoughts on ch7 (with mitten) and calling it a filler chapter and that made me feel insane. it's not filler. it's lucchini trying to prove to himself the overcoming fate is possible even if you're a weak little bug. he desperately needs everything he's doing to not be for nothing, and seeing what happened to mitten is like, witnessing the proof that he's going to fail despite it all. that's why he spends the whole chapter trying to help her, and why he breaks down at the end...</p>
        <details><summary class="cw">witch100 spoilers</summary>
        <p>if he was JUST evil then that chapter wouldn't be there!!!!!!! if it was always an act, then why go out of his way for mitten!!!!!!!!! why else would it matter to him!!!!!!!!!! in the distortion or whatever when you get his backstory and see him figuring things out and testing what he can change, he genuinely wants to protect everyone!!!! and then seeing that literally killing everyone in his whole village is the <em>only way forward</em> and he's forced to work with his father who he despises with his whole heart, oh my god!!!!!! i just feel like, of course the reveal in the "true ending" he's acting like that, because everyone still died and nothing mattered, in that position i would also be like "HAHA FUCK IT I GUESS!!!!!" it's really good... so yeah i guess anyone who looks at lucchini and thinks he's just a villain or whatever completely missed the point.</p>

        <p>LWT's battle system is pretty different from other rpgmaker games (only having attack and defend), was there ever a point in development where a full fledged battle system would've been considered?</p>

        <p>no because i only use the battles for storytelling purposes. i'm not interested in designing battle systems for the sake of it.</p>

I recall in the HTWML art collection it mentions that the ribbons nil are wearing are time's and I'm very curious on how that scenario played out like how did nil get hold of time's ribbons like I'm going to assume time gave her those ribbons I wanna ask like when ( if my assumption is wrong then uhh my bad then 😓😓 ) THIS QUESTION HAS BEEN ON MY MIND SINCE I REMEMBERED THAT INFO</p>

    <div class="ask">
        <p>So if Nil is transplanted onto everyone's memories... Does that mean that Nil still have the regular memories intact in her head?
</p><p>
I could see a disconnect between someone recalling something with Spice but Nil not knowing what they mean, but.. Spice also carried the Nil doll literally everywhere so I guess she *would* actually know what they're talking about... just from her own pov rather than Spice's</p>

    <div class="ask">
        <p>Hey Nami! Two little questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is Syrup arromantic or that's just a headcanon from some fans? I've seen some fanarts with her and the arromantic flag!</li>
<li>Do you have like an specific order for which games/projects you are going to make next? (Ex; syrup 2,SF book 2,vinegar game,etc,etc)</li>
        </ol>
    </div></div>

    <div class="response">
        <ol>
            <li>it was confirmed in apoc (<strong>edit:</strong> ok this answer caused confusion, i don't put labels on most of my characters' identities, but she has said in the comic that she isn't interested in romance so that's what i was referring to when i said it was confirmed.)</li>
            <li><p>ideally the order goes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lonely Wolf Treat</li>
                <li>Syrup 2</li>
                <li>Starry Flowers Book 2</li>
                <li>Vinegar is Never Getting Better</li>
            </ul>
            <p>but LWT and syrup 2 are extremely hard to finish and will take a lot of post-launch support so i might burn all my plans down and make vinegar game sooner. i shouldn't tho. i'm doing SAS updates inbetween all of these too.</p></li>

        <p>they sent over the art for approval, and i provided some references but they mostly did it on their own! i think it's cute having them in a different style, and since these won't be the only plushies to exist, i thought it was worth trying out... my wife has some dolls in this style too and you can dress them up and pose them and stuff, i think it's adorable. i'm looking forward to buying some alternate outfits for mine when i get them HEHEHE...</p>

        <p>What are your honest thoughts about Metallia from The Witch and the Hundred Knight? What do you like most about her, if applicable?</p>
    </div></div>

    <div class="response">
        <p>I LOVE METALLIA</p>
        <p>GET READY FOR A LONG POST (spoilers for witch100 and labyrinth of refrain)</p>
        <details class="readmore"><summary>read more</summary>
        
        <p>i want to start by saying witch100 was my favorite game after disgaea 4, it was only soured slightly in retrospect because of refrain, which i also intensely loved but have <em>problems</em> with. i feel like tatsuya izumi hates women, specifically gay disabled women, so he tortures them in all his games for fun. the bastard. but the characters are also very well written and witch100 does at least have a happily ever after BY SOME MIRACLE--i feel like because isara and velnya kissed on screen that's what kept them from getting an ending where they can actually be together and it makes me so mad. metallia was """ambiguously""" gay enough she dodged dying for it, but her and visco still die so much anyway!! omfg</p>
            
        <p>anyway i wanted to add the context of refrain into this becuase i think it's important, that there are a bunch of queer characters in these games WHICH IS GREAT, BUT!!!! he also doesn't fucking get it, as a writer, as a human!!!!! LIKE THE PRINCE IN GALLERIA, AND HOW KITCAT WAS HANDLED, I'M SO--no i can't get into it, it will have to be another post. even lilian was messy, but it was 2013 and i could look past that. because metallia and visco were so good together. i could ignore the harmful tropes cuz it had something i loved, which is girls who happen to fall in love and face immense suffering but somehow overcome it together. that's the good stuff, that's what im here for...</p>
        <p>so like, ok, metallia. she's got so many sharp edges. what she does to malia in ch1, that's a lot for a new player to swallow. who could love a character who does horrible despicable things??? (me, it's me)</p>
        <p>i think what i've consistently loved most is characters who are treated one way because of who they are on a surface level, but then you ACTUALLY look at them and realize there is so much nuance and they deserve better. metallia grew up completely alone and confined to her swamp for reasons beyond her control. if she tries to leave, she gets sick and dies. the two women who raised her abandoned her for reasons that are incomprehensible to her, and she was left with a boring golem servant and later an evil fairy. she's lonely and resents her position in life so she pours everything into studying magic to have concrete proof of how great she is and why she shouldn't have been abandoned.</p>
        <p>she wants desperately to not be alone but she's also BEEN alone for so long she's like, bandaged over this gaping wound pretending like it's not there. she's mean to people and pushes them further away because being vulnerable and honest with them sure didn't keep anyone around. she doesn't trust that anyone WOULD genuinely like her, which fuels the push and pull between her and visco, like she has to put visco in the category of "thing she owns" to justify her desire to keep her around, cuz she can't just say "I LIKE YOU PLEASE STAY WITH ME!!!" because it would be too painful if visco said no!!!!!!!! ough!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
        <p>their fight in... oh god what was it, i don't have the chapters memorized as well as i do with disgaea lol, at the big event in amataya where she gives visco the potion that's supposed to cure her curse but it fails in front of everyone and visco thinks she just did it to hurt her and metallia barks back because she only knows how to be combative and can't just APOLOGIZE, because clearly something's wrong and her solution should've worked!!! it's so heartwrenching... cuz by that point you know so deeply where each character is coming from and just want everything to be okay again WAHHH!!!!</p>
        <p>the whole... dark hero arc..... stitching together all these disperate parallel worlds to try to get HER visco back, meeting torude, the version of her who failed and can only support the metallia that DOES get to be with visco... oh my godddd toruuuddeee........ witch100's really got everything. the line where dulche asks if visco's metallia's lover and metallia's like N...NO/// coming right after the scene where torude's like hey here's a visco, she's real, wanna rub your hands all over her? it lives rent free in my head.</p>
        <p>metallia and visco's love story happens so naturally over the course of the whole story, i just, i couldn't even believe it it was so good. when you make it to walpurgis tower or whatever and visco's like so mad at the witches for being mean to metallia thinking metallia has been locked in her room crying about it this whole time, only to get there and metallia shows up giant and crashing the party and visco just laughs like "oh my god of COURSE you were planning this huge elaborate revenge, that's so funny actually???????" top 10 falling in love moments. visco really gets metallia's appeal.</p>
        <p>anyway metallia rules... but my favorite character is actually lucchini, if lucchini has only one defender it is me, if lucchini has no defenders i am dead.</p>

        <p>i figured BET would be a hit because i thought it was really really cool while i was making it. i'm glad it reached such a wide audience!</p>
        <p>i've actually had my art reach weird levels of internet fame since i was a teenager so it'd be weirder if i expected no one to care. i feel like treat has the potential to become as popular as BET once it's finished and reaches a wider audience, but maybe not. BET sells itself in its title, treat is something you have to really dig into to fully appreciate. WE'LL SEE... [sweating]</p>

        <p>Hi Nami! A bit of a silly ask here, my girlfriend and I have been having matching Treat/Mochi pfps for a while now, but we have been having trouble deciding which pictures to swap to next because of the distinct lack of solo Mochi art in the lwt page of your art directory! (I'm way too anxious to use very blatantly matching pictures from the same image being open about dating and being a lesbian is intimidating.) (Also this isn't me saying you have to make more solo Mochi art please just draw what you like.) I know fanart exists, but I was wondering if you had any fun ideas or recommendations for matching pictures so we could have "Nami sanctioned profile pictures." (her words, not mine) (she is pouting at me for typing out her exact wording it's so cute) (feel free to just ignore this if you want i would understand) (I am overthinking this so hard I need to stop adding more parentheses and just send this)</p>

        <p>Hello Nami! I hope you're doing well despite how hectic the Internet has been in the past few days. My pet bird Steven also hopes you're doing well! 
</p><p>mostly just here to check in, make sure you're doing okay, since yk everyone deserves some platform to talk about what's on their mind. But, I do also have some questions! </p>
<ol>
    <li><details><summary class="cw">LWT alt end spoilers</summary>For Bad End 2 of lwt (i think thats the Moxie one right?), will we ever see Chai's brothers face? Like will he ever get a talking sprite?</details></li>
    <li>Have you ever drawn any of the other main foxes with their warm weather colours or is it just Moxie?</li>
    <li>Between Timber, Moxie's Mom, and Senbei, who would you say is the most cruel?</li>
    <li>I dont rly remember if this has been answered before but does Moxie's Mom have an actual name?</li>
    <li>Not a question, just wanna say that how you overall made and handled SAS is amazing. Qmin tbh genuinely feels like someone ik or would get along with lol.</li>
    <li>also not a question but just rly wanted to say I rly love how you wrote Mauve! Tbh i rly connect &amp; kinda relate to them a lot, they kinda actually made me feel seen in a way I dont think I've felt before! So ig thanks for that! ^_^</li>
</ol>
<p>
sry if this is alot but i wanted to get it all out in 1 msg so you didnt get more work than you alr have! k hope you have a great week, remember not to overwork yourself, n hope you can recover &amp; bounce back well from the whole itch.io thing!</p>

            <li>senbei</li>
            <li>she doesn't so we just call her momxie</li>
        </ol>
        <p>ty for your questions and compliments, the itch.io stuff doesn't affect me as much as it does artists who mainly make adult works. it will just be annoying to figure out how to distribute my future nsfw comics (and games??) if the censorship groups succeed.</p>

    <div class="ask">
        <p>when nil replaced spice what actually changed? it seems like memories were changed but people can tell somethings off...so was the timeline shifted into nil having been the one with thyme all along? or did nothing else change? (i.e things that have to do with spice but not directly like a picture or memory of her)
...what happened to the nil plushies?</p>
    </div></div>

    <div class="response">
        <p>spice's existence was erased, even down to everyone's memories, and nil filled the gap. since they're different people, everyone feels a bit of cognitive dissonance but they can't really fathom what happened either so they just roll with it. this will be explicitly addressed later on (maybe like a year from now due to the pace of the comic lol)</p>
        <p>the plushies are no longer necessary so they mightve just got thrown in a closet. guess i'll draw a strip about it.</p>

        <p>Hi!! Just curious, will you be doing anything with Treat and the gang after her game is finished? Knowing your games I’m sure they’ll have cameos but will they just be small cameos or will they play more of a role in any future games. Given how long the game has taken I wouldn’t be surprised if you just wanted to leave them alone for a while lol.
</p><p>
Also since I put my icon as Vinegar and she’s a favorite of mine I mine as well ask, are you planning on making a Vinegar game or giving Vinegar focus at any point? I really like her!

Ooh One more thing actually! Not a question just wanted to say I really like the Trick newsletters! They always brighten my day when I see them! That’s all! Thanks a lot! Love all your games!</p>

    <div class="ask">
        <p>What was origins (og concepts) of Cassia? I mean, ur first idea of her?</p>
    </div></div>

    <div class="response">
        <p>i felt like designing a cute witch at random one day, and she's what came out. when i was looking for characters to put into starry flowers, i figured her design fit for the role i needed. a lot of treat npcs are recycled designs like that, too!</p>
        <p>people seemed to really like cassia after seeing her in starry flowers, so i wanted to use her in more games later on... there was a jam i had planned to do with some friends, and the concept for charm studies was made for that. i ended up dropping from that jam because of bad timing, but later made the game for NaNoRenO instead. that's the story!</p>

    <div class="ask">
        <p>Hello, Sophie! I recently played your game (Bad End Theatre), and I really enjoyed it. The art, music, characters, and overall concept of the game were all great. After completing the game with a good ending, I decided to explore the 41 bad endings you provided. As I completed each of the bad endings for each character, messages appeared. Did you want to convey a message to someone through these messages? I sincerely hope that you were successful, I was very touched, if it is possible, can you share your story with me? Who were these messages intended for, and why did you choose to convey them in this way? I'm sorry for being so intrusive, but I am deeply moved by your actions and the emotions you wanted to convey through this game... Thank you so much for your efforts, and I hope that everything will turn out well for you!! If there is anything I can do to support you, please let me know.</p>
    </div></div>

    <div class="response">
        <p>thanks for playing my game! the story is made up. when i first put the game together, it was only the bad end collecting part. when i thought about why all these bad endings would be constructed, i thought it would be really cool if the writer was reaching out to someone through them. that way the "maiden" and "overlord" could be given a happy ending and overcome their status as tragic yuri haha. it has nothing to do with my real life.</p>

        <h3>step by step process:</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>think of a plot and what characters would be needed in the plot</li>
        <li>draw concept art</li>
        <li>set up the project (usually ren'py) and write the script</li>
        <li>draw the character art and bgs as i write so the scene becomes real and so i can code specific faces for specific lines</li>
        <li>make songs to go along with the scenes</li>
        <li>send WIP builds to friends so they can agree with me about how good it is</li>
        <li>repeat steps 4-6 until the game is done</li>
        </ol>
        <p>it's pretty much that, except the asset creation part goes in whatever order i feel like.</p>

        <ol>
        <li>i use my tablet in place of a mouse so i can just start drawing anytime. i've lived this way since i got my first tablet and i think removing the barrier of having to set things up every time you want to draw will make you more likely to just start drawing when you otherwise wouldn't have. not sure if that's what you meant by consistency but i hope it helps.</li>
        <li>to add extra pages in comic fury, you can go to Webcomic Site/Layout &gt; Add Website Page in the sidebar. you can upload images in the text editor there iirc!</li>
        <li>these are my tablet settings, but you should do what feels comfortable to draw with for you</li>

    <div class="ask">
        <p>Who would you say is your favorite Deltarune character?</p>
    </div></div>

    <div class="response">
        <p>uhhhhhh hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm no one stands out to me... they're all good??? i think with toby fox's games i'm more there to admire the craft than anything else.</p>
        <p>ok no, i want to try and explain this better... there are some series where i DEFINITELY have a favorite character, even series that i think are not good (like aldnoah zero! bad show, obsessed with slaine troyard despite it all). so like when someone says "favorite character", i try to think if any character in the thing gives me a strong feeling like that... the "THAT'S MY GUY" feeling... and i don't get that with deltarune, i just feel like every character is good. none of them resonate with me, but it doesn't make them any less good. it's just because i don't have a strong attachment, i don't consider myself a fan at all--but when ch3+4 came out, i remember a coworker saying they'd have to replay the first two chapters because they didn't remember anything that happened, and that made something in me snap, like, HOW DO YOU PLAY DELTARUNE AND JUST NEVER THINK ABOUT IT AGAIN?????</p>
        <p>tl;dr i think there needs to be a word between fan and casual player, that's probably where i fall. i have a deep appreciation for it, but i don't have a favorite character. sorry for the weird answer.</p>

        <p>Hello Nami! Loved you since I found 'her tears were my light' in 2017/2018! Sorry if you get this alot, but is there still new content planned for Sex Advice Succubus, or is it over? Also, if you were to give any tips or tricks to new ren'py users or your story process in general, I would appreciate it! (Someone trying to make their own visual novel!)</p>
    </div></div>

    <div class="response">
        <p>SAS is definitely not over! i started working on a 3rd session but i haven't been able to write the script for it yet. i have at least two more sessions planned after that, but one of them will have erotic content, which i don't know if i'll be able to actually sell considering the recent steam/itch.io developments. i'm going to make it anyway, but i'll have to figure out a different release plan if that type of content is no longer able to be sold.</p>
        <p>as for ren'py tips, i have <a href="https://nomnomnami.com/blog/tags#--ren'py-tips">a series of blog posts</a> that might be helpful! good luck!!!</p>

    <div class="ask">
        <p>Haiiii. What are the extents of some of the wizards magic? From what I can remember magic is affected by emotions. So say if someone’s going through a heavy loss or tragedy could they flare up and cause something bad to happen?</p>
    </div></div>

    <div class="response">
        <p>if you can't concentrate, your spells won't come out right. so it's less that they could accidentally cause a disaster and more like, they won't be able to do things that used to come easy to them. it's like having burnout (extremely relatable for me lol)</p>

What was the magic she had? from what ik the only magic shes used is that soul separation spell &amp; that's why we have both vinegars

and a random Manjuu question, did you ever toss around the idea of maybe, just maybe having her improve for the better and stop hating wolves and such?</p>

        <li>hasn't been established, but she was able to learn astral spells so she's pretty skilled. too bad she can't use it without progressing her disease further...</li>

    <div class="ask">
        <p>Bit of a weird question -- Were there any thoughts on Trick's AGAB in their design? There's one sketch on the art collection where they seem to have breasts, which makes me think maybe they were originally supposed to be a girl like the others?
</p><p>
Also was Pastille originally intended to be intersex, or was that a later thing?</p>
    </div></div>

    <div class="response">
        <ol>
            <li>is this why people draw trick with boobs sometimes??? did i curse myself?????? trick's agab is not something i want people to be thinking about unless they're trans and projecting onto them (which i'm nervous to say because i don't want people to use this to police each other over it agh)</li>
            <li>established later on, i didn't know much about intersex conditions back in 2015 when i drew him. there's a game i played that made me feel confident about taking it in that direction, but saying which game it was is spoilers for that game so i haven't said it. it's one of my favorite vns tho.</li>

        <p>i use a xencelabs tablet, it's one of the smaller ones. external memory is definitely good if you're working in video, i'm not the person to ask about that though since i only make short videos sometimes.</p>

        <p>yes. for the epilogue i want to let you walk around the whole world as all four characters, i think for scope reasons i will have to limit where each character is allowed to go though. i have a lot of smaller stories planned for it so i can try to wrap everything up... it's still a long way off though...</p>

        <p>hello nami! you have inspired me to make my own webcomic! any tips on how to keep a weekly schedule for posting?</p>
    </div></div>

    <div class="response">
        <p>aw, yay! what works for me is drawing comics in advance. when i first started apoc, i posted the comics as soon as i finished drawing them... but i went on really long hiatuses because of that, since i didn't really have a good way to pace it out at the time (and i'd get distracted working on games and stuff instead)</p>
        <p>when i started planning once-a-week updates, i got a lot more consistent in uploading them without needing breaks. been going strong for a few years now... i usually write down my comic ideas whenever i think of one (i think of them often haha), and if it's a storyline i'll sit down and do a sketch version all at once, then as the next update day approaches i'll make sure i have a comic ready by the day before at least.</p>
        <p>you should plan your schedule to be extremely manageable in case life circumstances get in the way, like at one point i went on vacation for two months but because i only update once a week i only had to draw 8 comics in advance. it helps that they're only 3-panel comics too, so they don't take long to finish at all. knowing i can knock one out in an hour or so helps me to not feel overwhelmed when wednesday is looming and i don't have a comic ready yet... i still have to draw next week's too actually..... good luck with your webcomic, anon!</p>

Your games have inspired me to try making my own rpg maker game so I'm working on a short 10-20 minute game as my first project to get the hang of it and was wondering if you had any tips for getting inspirations for short stories? Everything I write either feels boring or far too ambitious for a short first time game</p>

        <p>any premise can be fun depending on the execution. give your characters a simple and straightforward goal, and obstacles to that goal will write themselves, that's my advice! good luck~</p>
