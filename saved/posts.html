            <p>hey is anyone on pillowfort btw? i thought it had asks (it doesn't) but it does at least have DMs... looking for a place to host the next moxdonalds-style ask comic, if i'm going to be posting that many images i want a streamlined process for it that is not my hacky ask page. i would archive it on my site afterwards tho. the reason i'm not doing tumblr is because i don't want anyone to join tumblr who isn't already on there (also cuz i'd probably get harassed lmao)</p>

            <p>weeks. weeks of waking up every morning and thinking about timber. i get out of bed 5-6am and start working on the game right away and i can't stop until midnight. i'm compelled. he compels me. i'm so glad i finally got to share a build but now my problem is i finished the next route and i want people to play it but the one after it has more important stuff connected to that route that i want people to get to experience them together, UGH BUT NOW WHEN PEOPLE PLAY THE PREVIOUS BUILD IM LIKE "YOU DON'T KNOW THE HALF OF IT!! YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW!!!!!" like there's so much going on in this game it's--HAHA it'll be 30k words after today!!!! i'm getting there!!!!! 125 cgs????? no problem!!!!!! it's not even all of them, ive only drawn one of the nsfw ones!!!!! hahaha!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
            <p>sorry, i've gone absolutely feral writing this, i have a desperate need to express these emotions cuz working on the game is only making me feel stronger and i might explode. burnout is over, we're so back. i can do anything, i can make anything... timber.......... *clutches heart* you guys don't even know yet...!!!!!</p>
            <p>maybe once it's out i can openly gush about individual scenes but like thats just going to be me pointing at everything in the game and going HHGHGHGGHGGGGG but you should just play it, it'll be free, for the price of $0 you can never think about anything but timber again</p>
            <p>i'll open asks after it comes out.</p>

            <p>i think NOT getting to post games is suffering, i want to share my art as soon as it's done, i want to let my work evolve in front of people so they can watch it grow with me and we can go "OH MY GOD???????????" together</p>

            <p>i am writing/drawing <strong>the dark content</strong> for nwt now and my god this game is self indulgent. im like... OUGH... what if i always just make what i think is compelling and not worry about going too far. i wanna feel this intensely about every game i make. it's not even like i was particularly censoring myself before, it's more like i've unlocked new options...? games can be like this????? the rules were made up??????? i can make nwt and everyone loves it???????????? (thanks to the patrons who played and sent me their feelings)</p>
            
            <p>i think... the thing that held me back before with other games, is like trying to make them more and more polished and a solid "product" yknow, but indie games can be messy and fucked up, i can spend all day drawing with my pixel brushes and get so much art done instead of what happened with starry flowers where there was so much to draw and it took so long to color everything even though the result was amazing, i think it has intimidated me away from making the sequel, in my head it will take such a long time to finish but actually i can make a game really fast if i just let myself have fun with it</p>
            
            <p>ok in the starry flowers book 2 case in particular i needed syrup 2 to come out first, which, the story content i wanted people to know for sf2 is in the early access build, so i can actually make that game anytime now. i wanna keep the art style mostly but theres some parts i will be able to do something different with HEHEH i look forward to that...</p>
            
            <p>but first... im finishing timber game asap... then i think i can amp up to get some treat stuff done, i'm feeling the pull thanks to timber... thanks timber...! i love you timber!!!! *keeps hurting him* i love you so much!!!!!!!</p>

            <p>the fact that i am opening treat but just for NWT reference... i wish i had this kind of fervor to finish the rest of LWT, but that one's a marathon not a sprint... NWT is absolutely a sprint tho, im running down a hill and cannot stop. CAN I MAKE A PATRON BUILD THIS WEEKEND??? I MIGHT!!!!!</p>

            <p>there's a straight line from me drawing fenrich disgaea 4 as a girl in 2013 to the entirety of lonely wolf treat existing, and if you didn't know that, now you do</p>

            <p>the sheer amount of consequences that spilled out from "syrup and butterscotch should go to a snowy mountain to get a candy ingredient together, i guess wolves show up" → "treat's pack can't be the ones who randomly chase after people, i guess there's a different pack they split off from who are more hostile" → "what if i make an alternate ending where you meet that pack since otherwise the story will never touch on them"</p>
            <p>and now timber exists and i spend a month writing a game about him because one side chapter wasn't enough. everything is syrup's fault, that's why it should be called syrupverse (candyverse???) instead of namiverse</p>

                <p>to go off for a bit in response to BlueDogXL's comment, what i love about the bad ends is that you really can think for a second that they aren't real and can't hurt you, but all the lore stuff that is revealed in them is absolutely still a thing in the true ending. you just never find out about it. timber is still at large, the taxidermy wolves are still in the warren, senbei is still a dangerous fascist who brought his family here under the guise of "protecting rabbits" but is really there to profit off their hatred and pursue his own freak obsessions--haha wait that last part is only really hinted in the battle conversation isn't it??? hahaha!!!! don't worry, there's more on the way!!!!!!!</p>
                <p>i replayed bad end 1 earlier today because i was like, oh god i need to see it again after having established all this new timber canon, and it was like... SUCH A TREAT (sorry).... he has so many lines where im like YES AND THIS IS YOUR MOTIVATION FOR SAYING THAT AND IT'S GOING TO BECOME 100% CLEAR TO PEOPLE WHO PLAY NIGHT WITH TIMBER, NO ONE WILL BE LEFT GUESSING, I'LL SPELL IT OUT FOR EVERYONE!!! and tundra too, like her lines are so manipulative, i was so struck by her being like "yeah look what your mom did to my face, am i really the only one who seems dangerous???"" OUGH tundra plays such a small role in lwt but if you're clever you can tell she's why timber is like that...... it's almost like... rabbits killing her partner started a cycle of violence that continues to this day...... ouchie!! oof!!! the pain, i'm so fascinated!!!!!</p>

            <details class="spoiler"><summary>night with timber spoilers</summary>
                
                <p>yesterday i was explaining some stuff about NWT to the people i live with and had to say that timber and senbei have never interacted in canon, they havent even met yet, which was making me lose it because HAHA THEY HAVE NOW!!!! OH AND IT'S BAD!!!!!! OH NO IT'S REALLY BAD!!!!!!!!!</p>
                
                <p>i made the first build today to send to a friend, i need to fill in some more art and write the last couple scenes that can be reached in these routes and then i can make the patron build HAHAHAHA oh my god it's getting close. there's no music whatsoever but you dont need it to feel the weight of what's going on in there.</p>

            <p>harada is brave enough to give his kemonomimi characters the extra set of human ears, why can't i... or wait, maybe it's just piriko... ohh rutile has an extra bit of hair tuft in place of the ears, i see i see... *taking notes* this is why it's so hard to draw short haired animal folk, i would like to do more but needing to cover the human ears makes it so awkward!!!!! i can't confirm or deny their existence at this point, this is my annoying struggle!!!</p>

            <p>actually here's my problem, the tone of my works can range from "wholesome" to dark (comedy) to erotic and if you're in the audience for two of those things it probably mostly works out for you, but if youre only there for one thing i can imagine everything that's not that just feels annoying to read</p>
            <p>anyway timber game gets really fucked up and won't be for everyone, but i don't care, it's for ME, i already made my ultimate crowd pleasing game so now i get to go wild on niche stuff, i can afford to do that.</p>

            <p>at this point i don't remember why i started making timber game other than "haha i could do date timber for next april fools day", but it became so serious, i'm fast approaching 20k words (longer than BET and syrup 1)........ it has its hooks in me like nothing else, usually i can resist a project im excited about to focus on things im SUPPOSED to be finishing sooner, but i literally wake up at 6am and start writing/drawing and don't stop unless i'm physically pulled away, and i've been stuck in this state for weeks even through a trip out of town.</p>

            <p>i guess i'll explain it for people who are new here. hi im nami and my favorite game is disgaea. this has been the case since i was about 12 years old, my first sketchbooks have disgaea fan art because i started getting serious about drawing after playing disgaea for the first time, because i was so enamored with the aesthetic. my sense of character design leans heavily on what harada has done with disgaea characters (and all his work in general really), like i can point to specific elements for most of my characters and go "yeah i draw it this way because i like how it looks on this other character." lately i've been thinking about how timber is an exact mix of elements from my two favorite disgaea men (fenrich and valvatorez) so no wonder i'm having so much fun drawing him. you can't look at my games and not see disgaea, it's not allowed, if you don't know about disgaea i'm telling you to go play it. look closely and you'll see. i have a catalogue of harada's art in my head that i am drawing from, i need everyone to know this about me.... the blocky way he draws hands... the fun silhouettes, all the different cute eye shapes... disgaea 4 was his best design era imo, i am always thinking about those characters......</p>
            <p>on that note i've been watching a friend play through disgaea 6 so i'm finally seeing it and it's not a good game but the art is really good anyway... i love to look at it..... why do the character busts look way better than 5 and 7's, i mean except for bieko, i dont know why she looks like that. zed is good. the skits are cute, i wish they put skits in 7, they're so fucking funny i'm constantly laughing. my writing/sense of humor is all disgaea too, i'm begging everyone to play disgaea... yes even the bad one..... COME ON........</p>

            <p>i got hit by a car while riding my bike last monday (i'm fine, it was a pretty low-speed collision) but my freaking HIP HURTS and it only started being super painful today/yesterday, so it might be a bone bruise or something... luckily my lifestyle mostly consists of sitting at my desk and working on games, which does not cause me pain and in fact heals the soul</p>
            <p>no matter who may try to strike me down, i WILL finish timber game!!!!! i am DYING to post a build (perhaps literally????????)</p>

            <p>updated the syrup 2 build again, the bugs have been pretty minor so far... which is great...!!!</p>
            <p>i have been feeling a little bad that i am completely timber-brained for syrup's anniversary month, but you know....... i deserve a little treat....... (wait no not that one)</p>

            <p>uhh, um, *sweating* do i advertise my nsfw patreon????? they still don't let nsfw creators sell individual posts on there (which, selling posts was the whole reason i made the damn thing) I ASSUME because patreon is having the same exact struggle against payment processors that itchio and steam are.</p>
            <p>anyway this is going to destroy everyone's first impression of the game maybe, but i shared <a target="_blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/scene-from-night-140323512">scene from night with timber (18+)</a> on there, so i'm posting to let people know that exists if they are curious. (i'm so embarrassed i might die, no one talk to me about it)</p>
            
            <p>LIKE.......... ok i have not felt this kind of passion since making starry flowers, which is how i know it will be good. definitely not for everyone but i'm obsessed. this game will be free btw because i can't sell it due to payment processors!!!!!!!! haha!!!!!!!!!! it's gonna have a big stupid "are you 18 or older" when you start up the game!!!!!! that's the best i can do!!!!!!!!!!! hahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! there's more i want to say about the content, but it'd be massive spoilers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! bye i guess!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

ANYTHING?????) but anyway, i wanted to make a post to say i will not be updating my site until probably the 30th (when syrup 1 comes out on steam.. oh no.) goodbye for now, also look forward to the syrup 2 demo on october 1st (life comes at you fast!!!!)</p>

            <p>in other news, i've been working on a new section of my site, but it will need a javascript sidebar because i'm still too scared of SSGs. i don't like js either but it's slightly less scary. anyway it's cute so far, but i've been having trouble focusing so i mostly just cleaned my house and did puzzles today. having a relaxing weekend!</p>

            <p>alright the other thing that failed the review was the gallery illustrations didn't unlock, because i forgot to add the code for it. but the way i coded it for console was a bit tedious, so this time i coded it in a way that if you already beat syrup 1 back in the day and still have that save data on your computer, it will automatically know which ones you... wait i should write a proper post for how to code image galleries in ren'py, that would be useful</p>

            <p>NIS just announced <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/nippon-ichi-software-announces-action-rpg-kyouran-makaism-for-ps5-switch-2-and-switch" target="_blank">kyouran makaism</a> and i have thoughts</p>
            <details class="readmore"><summary class="readmore">read more</summary>
            
                <p>i SHOULD like it. theoretically i should like it. aesthetically it's my favorite guys (harada and tenpei sato) plus the director of disgaea 7 (which i loved). but i don't fucking care about action games!!!!!! i don't want to run around hacking and slashing or whatever!!! i put up with it in hundred knight because i love metallia and because the aesthetic was so unique, but this game looks like every other 3d anime world game, i'm bored!!!! i'm so bored, i don't want to look at this!!!!</p>
                
                <p>this isn't NIS's fault but youtube ruined <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeiijXYpkrM" target="_blank">the trailer</a> for me by autodubbing it, so the audio was garbage and had an ai voice talking over it the whole time and i was so confused. i hate ai so much. why would they do this to me. i just woke up and they'd do this to me? maybe that's part of why i feel extra cranky about this...</p>
                
                <p>but like, ok for one, look at the vn cutscenes. they just use the 3d models, i don't want to fucking look at 3d models!!!!!!! i KNOW it's a budget thing, i know!!!! and their models have gotten a lot better, but for THE STORY SCENES????? they make it work for ace attorney but this is not......... it's just not there.......</p>
            
                <p>i'm not into the character designs either honestly, these two look like a worse version of killisera for some reason hahaha, i haven't been loving harada's more recent designs in general but... why does tisiel look like that. this is such a small thing but i don't like that the bows on her dress are teal when her eyes and earrings are regular blue, it stands out so much, it makes me think of back in the day when mugen souls came out (one of the first fake-harada artstyle games) and the color palettes all felt SLIGHTLY WRONG... i don't like it...! it's not that she would even be fixed by sticking to one blue either, i don't see the appeal of this character (sorry girl) because all i can see her as is a mix of elements from more unique past characters (rozy, sera, a little bit beryl...) and it's the same for mr. ennui (gematsu sais neuer but it reads enue- and considering his personality i'm guessing it's supposed to be like ennui), he's the same red/black/white they keep doing for disgaea protags but even having the same palette shouldn't hold you back from looking like a totally new character. val and mao are way different despite sharing a palette, it's just balanced differently... mr. ennui are you supposed to be what a cool guy looks like... having two-tone hair and scarf doesnt make you more unique it just makes you look like a tryhard SORRY!!! IN THIS POST I AM A HATER!!!!!!</p>
                
                <p>ok putting aside my silly nitpicks for more serious criticism. NIS is like, desperately trying to move away from disgaea being their only flagship series, that's what they said with phantom brave 2. but even ignoring the world and reused monsters, the systems are disgaea, it's still reincarnation and item world and... it just feels like so much is recycling what was already there to the point it doesnt make any sense? like i wish they would just go all-in and make something brand new??? and they HAVE, they've made all sorts of games--i'm not even against disgaea spinoffs, the prinny games were really great!!! every day i'm praying they make another disgaea vn because i loved infinite so much!!!!!! but there's a fundamental issue, there's two factions of gamers: people who like to hone their skills and reaction time to execute something cool, and people who like to sit there and think and press buttons at their own pace... a puzzle game is always hard sell for action gamers and action games continue to be a hard sell for me. i don't get fulfillment out of the challenges presented by action games, it is always just something i'm putting up with to get to the good parts (usually story...)</p>
                
                <p>i think... i think i just really wish this was its own thing and not lifting all this stuff from disgaea that doesnt make any sense, that's what it feels like to me right now. i don't play musou/warriors games so maybe i would have a different opinion if i knew more about the genre, but it has never appealed to me! if i'm mindlessly clearing out enemies, i would rather play vampire survivors. it just feels like they keep taking more and more strategy out of their games to appeal to a wider market (6's fucking autobattle shit) but then you end up with nothing left. i wanted to do the fun strategy, why are you acting like you're so ashamed of it? i don't think i'll be buying this.</p>

            <p>HM, i've been having trouble with steam builds (syrup 1 says the automated tests failed and it'll take extra time??? eek), i had planned on releasing the syrup 2 demo on october 1st but if it can't get approved on time, i'll just release it on itch.io first...</p>
            <p>there's still a week before i leave on a short trip, but knowing i will be out of town and unable to upload new builds during that time is stressful... that's why i tried to submit early, so that itd be approved weeks ahead of time but that didn't happen!!! ARGH!!!!!!!! anyway i hope it'll all work out, like i said it'll be up on itch.io either way!</p>

            <p>i happened across kemono teatime on steam and bought it instantly because it's NOCO's designs (i love atelier sophie) but i didn't realize it would check every box for me beyond that. i'm obsessed with this game now.</p>

            <p>wait oh my god i just remembered i had a dream i changed mince's design but then realized i already drew them on the title screen and i started getting stressed about having to remake assets in time... what's going on in my brain, i love how mince looks, they can't be changed!!!</p>

            <h3>PSA</h3>
            <p>if you're planning to submit a ren'py game to next fest (like i am) your build will fail the review because of <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/renpy/renpy/issues/6580">an issue with steam libraries</a> or whatever. i made a build with ren'py 8.4.1 and just got the email today that it failed, so i'm resubmitting with a build made in 8.3.6... we are also updating return to ash with new translations today, so that would've been broken if i had not learned about this just now...</p>
            <p>the bug is that the game crashes when launched through the steam client, so i guess if the 8.3.6 build works for return to ash then i can assume it will work for syrup and everything can proceed on schedule!!! i'm nervous because i'm going to be traveling on the 25th so i hope everything is approved on time!!!!!! EEK!!!!!!!!!</p>
            <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> build worked, i am less afraid now</p>

            <p>maybe, perchance, what i actually want is to just move things around in a sensible way, like putting my ren'py tips on another section of the site so they're not just buried in my dev diary with a billion game-specific posts. that way i'll be more inclined to add more when i think of them instead of going "oh i should write something up about that, ahh too bad it's kind of a hassle i'll figure it out later" and then just forget</p>
            <p>i wanna build good resources that are easy to link to!!!!!! i wanna save people time learning code junk, for the other non-programmers out there!!!!!!! (i dont think i can call myself a non-programmer anymore tho)</p>

            <p>took another look at static site builders today and.. hmmm.... i want the optimization, i want the convenience, but i DONT WANT to not be able to see a live preview!!!!!!! maybe im spoiled by my code editor... maybe i cant be boxed in....... i also know migrating my blog would be a ton of work when i could be doing more productive things. but rn i dont like updating my blog because it's a hassle to work with... so i do need to do something different but im not sure what yet. i miss cohost.</p>

            <p>why did i set up my homepage like that, it's so annoying to work with...</p>
            <p>anyway SITE UPDATE SUCCESS, took the merch section down yet again but... now that i'm checking... it looks like the <a href="https://plushwonderland.com/collections/lonely-wolf-treat" target="_blank">trick plush</a> is still up?! maybe they've taken mercy on them for getting close enough to the goal! i probably shouldn't speculate but 👀 if so, it's great news for trick fans... once my schedule clears up i'll get serious about producing some official merch myself (like buttons and charms), i've been hesitant because of the tariff nonsense...</p>
            <p>OH THAT'S RIGHT... I DON'T THINK I MENTIONED HERE... the BAD END THEATER cds can't be restocked anymore because it costs too much to make them now!!! argh!!!!!! we're working on a solution though so stay tuned for happier news at some point i hope...</p>

            <p>new page for <a href="/games/syrup-2/">syrup 2 updates</a> is live! it turned out to be pretty quick to throw together, and someone happened to report a bunch of minor bugs this morning so i actually had fixes to report. my changelog used to be private in notion and it was sort of a pain to keep it updated, i think having a public one will be more fun! i get to write silly stuff like "toffee won't pick up money anymore if your bond is too low" lol.</p>
            
            <p>i gotta do some more site maintenance... i never made that return to ash page for the doodle comics from 2 months ago. it finally reached 50 steam reviews... which i guess is some kind of milestone... idk, my perspective right now is that it's a flop but honestly i think it's just a sleeper hit. mostly i'll feel bad if i wasted the publisher's money, but i enjoyed making it anyway.</p>
            
            <p>oh and i think the steamodded dl for balatreat is broken or something? a friend kindly sent me a fix and i hadn't uploaded it yet... i don't use steamodded, but i need to update the dl in case anyone else does... i'll try to do these things today because i'm avoiding making a syrup 1 build (there is only tedious work to be done for the steam version haha)</p>

            <p>oh also syrup 2 early-early access is out on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/syrup-2-candy-138285268">patreon</a>, i would love if everyone played it and told me how good it is HEHEH (just kidding but it's pretty good so i hope everyone enjoys it)</p>
            <p>next i'm planning to make a little syrup 2 roadmap page on my site so i can post things i'm planning to add to the game... i think that'd be fun... but i also need to submit the syrup 1 build to steam for approval soon so it can launch at the end of the month. busy busy!!! so happy i could release a syrup 2 build tho, excited to add more story before the for-real early access launch! let's gooo!!!</p>

            <p>oh my god, so i learned you can <a target="_blank" href="https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/build.html#packages">build different packages</a> with renpy, which is what i needed for syrup 2 so i could make a separate demo build without copying the entire project... i set everything up for this but i was like how the hell can i check if youre playing the demo or not, persistent flags?!?!? that's impractical...</p>
            <p>so npckc told me about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/file_python.html#renpy.loadable">renpy.loadable()</a> which checks if a certain file exists. "great!" i think, "i'll just tell it to check for an image from the second half of the game!" haha cool! except the images are buried in folders so i have to specify the directory, so it works correctly in the launcher but not in builds where the file is archived. "it loads files from inside archives" SURE!!! BUT THE ARCHIVE IS IN THE BASE FOLDER WHERE IT'S NOT TELLING IT TO LOOK omg, i was trying all combinations of things because there was a space in the filename i picked too and i know computers can be funky about spaces in filenames...</p>
            <p>anyway I GOT IT WORKING, IT WORKS NOW!!!! i just put the file it should be looking for in the game directory so it doesn't get confused anymore... i'm so glad i can make demo builds so easily now, no more strife... the hard work is over...</p>
            <p>what if i give the game to patrons tomorrow... hahaha..... i shouldn't because there's more art i wanted to finish, and my friends aren't done playtesting the one i sent out today. it's getting soooooo close. the story isn't finished but you can play so much of it... cries....... i love you syrup 2, anything for syrup 2..............</p>

            <p>i've been neglecting OCs you can steal all month sadly, but i just caught up on submissions to make up for it... i added some of my own, too! (<a target="_blank" href="https://ocsyoucansteal.neocities.org/ocs/sporna">sporna</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://ocsyoucansteal.neocities.org/ocs/reed">reed</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://ocsyoucansteal.neocities.org/ocs/cannoli">cannoli</a>)</p>
            <p>the <a target="_blank" href="https://plushwonderland.com/collections/lonely-wolf-treat">treat plushies</a> have about 2 weeks left to get funded! treat's almost to 90%, and moxie's almost to 70, but i don't know if mochi and trick are gonna make it... my fingers are crossed for them....... i mean, if they don't make it i'll just try again in the future, or maybe limit myself to merch where i can just produce it on my own instead of needing to hit certain preorder quantities. i am notoriously bad at managing merch stuff though (apoc volume 2 still hasn't been printed SORRYYYY) so.. who knows... ok that's the end of my ramble, back to syrup 2 dev</p>

            <p>maybe i am just loyal to itch.io after selling my games there for nearly 10 years. it gave a home to my games and comics over all these years, i built a huge following there selling my gay little VNs and rpgmaker games. i didn't make a ton of money on there compared to steam and consoles, but i wouldn't have reached the point to be able to release on those larger platforms without first getting to play around making smaller things for my itch.io-based audience.</p>
            <p>i found so many other queer games i love through game jams and made friends with other devs--some of them i consider to be my best friends, even. without itch.io i wouldn't have had a home for my nsfw comics, and i wouldn't have felt encouraged to draw more after the positive response that came from itch.io users.</p>
            <p>itch.io means a lot to me, and i'll be devastated if it goes away. i want them to do everything they can to make sure that doesn't happen, which is exactly what they're doing right now. they wouldn't be taking such drastic actions if they didn't think it was necessary. please don't be mad at itch.io... be mad at the people who made them do this for no good reason.</p>

            <p>i feel the need to impress on everyone how much itch.io is doing the best they can right now (though i am probably preaching to the choir here...)</p>
            <p>imagine the federal government bans the sale of strawberries. everyone must stop growing them, strawberries are evil now. the govt sends notice both to walmart and to your local farmer's market, that if they sell any strawberries from now on, they will be shut down. walmart tosses all the evil strawberries into the garbage, you can't get strawberries at walmart anymore but you can still buy raspberries and whatever else. meanwhile, your local farmer's market puts a tarp over any tables that brought strawberries. you can still buy them, you just have to ask directly. if they don't do this, everyone in the market will have nowhere to sell their goods, even the ones who have never grown a strawberry in their lives.</p>
            <p>think about which group/company fills which role in this story and think about the one you should ultimately be getting mad at.</p>

            <p>on a lighter note, i did feel more optimistic after seeing itchio's <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content#addendum-faq" target="_blank">update addendum</a> today. and i'm glad the card companies are getting slammed with phone calls too. maybe something will change for the better thanks to the concentrated effort. maybe we can all sell our nsfw drawings online like normal again u.u</p>

            <p>OH okay so i just reached out to patreon support and it turns out they haven't rolled out the ability to Sell Your Posts for adult creators. well. join my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/nomnomnsfw" target="_blank">18+ patreon</a> to download all my nsfw comics, i even put up the thumbnails for the new one.</p>
            <p>sorry that i have two patreons now, if itch.io is forced to ban nsfw forever it's basically my only option. hopefully that won't happen and i will just have an extra place to post the occasional nipple or whatever. until it gets banned on patreon too. (these are my worries...)</p>

            <p>preparing for the next ask session, which means sorting everything from the "latest" page into their respective tags... but now that im doing it im like ohhh i want to sort this better... the lore page is so long compared to the other tags but i mean thats also what fans are always going to ask about so of course it's long... the problem is theres too much to read through as an archive, and i haven't even finished going through the cohost backlog (i put it on the backburner since it's accessible through the wayback machine)</p>
            <p>MANY THOUGHTS. if i'm not careful i'll tempt myself into endlessly building my website instead of putting out games, but i guess return to ash just came out so i don't need to rush to the next thing either... also this type of thing IS fun for me, and i need to have fun and relax sometimes. ok back to work!!!</p>

            <p>told my patrons i'd put up the return to ash postmortem on monday but i just keep writing... it's so long..... i probably did not need to write this much but i had a lot to say i guess. sorry for the delay u guys, i'm not sure if i'll finish it tonight either (no one is demanding it but still...)</p>

            <p>i'm two seconds away from writing a giant screed on why you should never tell me things like "wow i normally hate VNs but i loved yours!"--it's not a compliment, it just makes me sad. consider: i love visual novels which is why i make them. have you counted the number of visual novels you've actually played? or are you falling back on the stereotype of vns being those "weird japanese porn games" with no deeper meaning. ooooohhh it makes me so mad...</p>

            <p>so funny story... i broke achievements for BET... which means they were broken for return to ash too. i just gave them a build to patch it, so once the game updates, people can actually get the achievements. sorry for my negligence!!!!!! i had to install a fresh copy of ren'py at some point and forgot you have to manually add steam support to make achievements work lol.................</p>

            <p>we forgot to add the steam achievements for the game, they're up now tho!!! if you already played through, it should unlock them when you start up the game... sorry for the oversight....... i wanted to have the soundtrack up for sale/streaming too but they're still working on it. i'm gonna be putting the download up for patrons over the weekend (i'm tired!!!)</p>
            <p>i'm alsooo still working on updating all the pages of my website to the new layout! i'll be archiving the return to ash comic on its own page... not sure if i should delete the posts here or leave them up in both places, hmm. i guess i'll leave them, another thing i wanted to do is move the 2024 posts to an archive page, so... yeah my site todo list is ever-expanding.....</p>
            <p>gonna be opening asks ummmmmm next weekend???? or... sometime next week, i'm gonna be traveling again on the 25th so i'll have to close them after a few days. wahoooooo!</p>

            <p>ahh i ended up looking through my old tumblr dev blog since a friend reminded me of something and skimming through the posts made me really miss being on tumblr... i can't go back though, that place has changed too much and i already post here and host my own ask blog... oh speaking of which, i'm planning on opening asks after return to ash comes out, maybe during the following weekend but i'll see how i feel... i don't wanna force myself, it's more fun if i go at my own pace</p>
            <p>the old tumblr blog was privated a long time ago btw, but there's some good stuff in there that i want to reupload here on my site, as long as i can figure out how to present it exactly. it's where i posted all my work-in-progress screenshots, which was easier to do on tumblr... oh i guess it wouldnt be anymore tho because they stretch all the images to full-width...... ok my site wins again, nostalgia over, we can't go back to those times.</p>

            <p>i'm reading through my original notes from 2021 (because i wrote the outline for this sequel basically right after finishing the first game) and there's a part in here that wholesale got put in astra's garden. i forgot i wrote it for this game.</p>

            <p>alright, finished a big <a href="/blog/posts/2025-06-04-dev-diary-return-to-ash-and-studio-life.html">blog post</a>!! now i can rest!!!!</p>
            <p>one thing i forgot to mention tho, is that they accidentally set the release date on steam for june 10th--it was supposed to be JULY 10th. the game isn't coming out for another month, but we have a demo we want to put up in the next few weeks, so it's still coming soon!!! wahhh!!!!!</p>

            <p>new game announced just now!!! this is ash!!!! she's good i love her!!!!!! her game touches on subjects similar to what i want to write about with vinegar, so this is almost like a proto-vinegar game, except ash and vinegar are very different people. ok not that different, they both like video games. ash is human tho. lore unrelated to the rest of my stuff since i'm making it with a studio lol.</p>
            <p>i feel like there were a billion things i wanted to say except i wasn't allowed to say them yet, and now that i can talk i'm drawing a blank. for now, enjoy the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lz5hM24poMI" target="_blank">announcement trailer</a>!</p>

            <p>i feel like i havent made a game in 1000 years but really it's only because i did make a game, it was finished in april, and they said we can finally announce it JUNE 4TH!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and then i guess before that was the new part for LWT ch8, so that's only a "new game" insofar as treat fans got to see more story. before that was... uh... oh no... OH NO BEFORE THAT WAS ALSO LWT CH8....... IVE ONLY DONE LUDUM DARES BETWEEN THEN, NO WONDER I FEEL LIKE THIS!!!!!!</p>
            <p>i mean i have an excuse, ive spent a lot of time on my website and larger projects, and apoc has been updating consistently so it's not like there's nothing. but i... perhaps once i finish out my current obligations i'll knock out another short game. im really feeling the urge. short stories are really where i thrive, long projects have always killed me, but i can never resist them either. i crave freedom... i gotta release more games... WAIT I NEED TO UPDATE STARRY FLOWERS FOR PRIDE TOMOR--nevermind may has 31 days in it, we're safe</p>

            <p>i mostly did programming on this one... oh, and the backgrounds. the ui was split between me and npckc, and the writing was mainly donutshoes, but kc and i handled some parts! the script came out pretty cohesive for having 3 writers... ahh, another fun jam has ended. i hope people enjoy our silly little story.</p>

            <p>my new MV is out! i got excited and put a lot of work into it, so i hope you'll check it out.</p><p> i think i posted on cohost about this song almost being done like a year ago, but i got stuck on it until i was finally brave enough to open the project again to try to finish it for teto's birthday. i'm a few days late because i got too ambitious with the MV, but 4/4 is a fun day to release on since 4's are cursed/death-related in japan.</p>
            <p>i'm feeling more confident with music lately, so i'm going to see if i have the time/energy to finish up more of my WIP songs... still striving for that first album......!</p>

            <p>ok before i could post that i was like I NEED TO SWAP COMMENTS SYSTEMS but i knew i would want to edit my css a lot if i started doing that, so um... i got carried away again...</p>
            <p>anyway PLEASE suggest new accessories for peri in the comments, there's a layer on top and behind him so it's pretty flexible... i just can't draw things in his mouth since his expression changes... oh i might be able to do glasses though...? wait what if i add a third layer (i have a different game to be finishing rn!?!?!?!????)</p>

            <p>ah, march is almost over... it looks like we won't get to announce the new game until next month... it's getting close tho... 40k words...... thats so many words............ thats my biggest vn excluding syrup 2.................. waow</p>
            <p>i keep feeling bad for being very quiet but all my energy has gone into work and life (and farming games to relax...) it gets so hard to think sometimes. i'm doing well though. so many big announcements coming..... ahhhh.............</p>

            <p>i have... a problem.... i have been playing fields of mistria, and the ui is so cute and functional that it is making me rethink the syrup 2 alchemy ui... i do not think i should re-code that screen but im very very tempted to change the list of text buttons to JUST icons, because rn the lists are kinda unuseably long and more difficult than necessary to navigate... i don't have time to work on syrup 2 rn but i am always thinking about it</p>

            <p>im going to replace my comments section with the same comment widget im using for my <a href="/guestbook/">guestbook</a> and <a href="/ocsyoucansteal/index.html">ocs you can steal</a> since i can't sort komments to be reverse chronological to match my posts. i also might start using tags since i figured out how to do that for ocs you can steal... that way i can post important updates here and have a way to sort through things quickly</p>
            <p>ALSO the new game announcement is coming, we are waiting on another exciting thing to be ready so we can announce at the same time. i'm dying to finally share it, i've been working on it pretty nonstop the past few months (which is why i've been a little quieter than usual)</p>

            <p>i think it's time i gave in and started calling treat/syrup universe the namiverse like everyone else... mostly because i want to make a new page for my site that explains the order to play all my interconnected games in, and nomnomnami.com/namiverse is a good and memorable url.</p>
            <p>anyway that's what i'm doing to relax tonight</p>

            <p>the past 2 or so weeks i kept getting stuck in bed for most of the day just being extremely fatigued, and i thought it was my lack of good rest (my cat wakes me up around 6am daily) or my anemia back with a vengeance (i've been off my iron pills for a while now), but no. i'm pretty sure it was just because i switched to taking my anti-anxiety meds in the morning instead of right before bed, thinking it might be better for me.</p>
            <p>it was not better. i am ready to function normally again please!!!</p>

            <p>finished phantom brave 2 tonight!!!!!! i have many thoughts but i'm not sure how/where to type them up... if i have the energy for it i'll write a full spoiler-filled review but for now i will say: i liked it overall, the character models are SOOOOOOOOOO cute and i was surprised at just how much art was in the game. i'm happy more people will know marona and ash through this game, because they're very good.</p>

            <p>i'm glad i waited because i've been learning javascript in the meantime so i got to add usernames! omg my original plan was to just ask people to sign their name in the ask, but now the page remembers you so you don't have to type it in each time.</p>
            <p>i expect my setup to evolve as i get annoyed and optimize things, but i'm looking forward to all the treat questions that i'm sure are coming :)</p>
