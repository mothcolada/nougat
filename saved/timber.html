            <p>um ok comments on this page are broken but it's weird that they load even though the submit button doesn't work...? i'm investigating...</p>
            
            <p><strong>update:</strong> WELL... i can't get the submit button to show up and have no clue why only THAT part of the javascript would be broken. i'm using this widget the same as i've used on the ocs you can steal site so it's weird that it's broken here. can someone smarter than me tell me what i'm doing wrong... sobs</p>

            <p>can't stress enough how i feel completely possessed writing this game. i'm not in control. it's inside me and it has to come out. i'm shocked at the contents. i would never have guessed or planned to write this. i am just compelled. will there be consequences for releasing this? brainworms for all...</p>

                <p>more seriously, the amount of character that has been injected into senbei during this game... like... he is a frightening man, he's literally a fascist for the fun of it, but getting to see from his perspective is like... IT'S SO FUCKED UP JKDSHGKJ he's so despicable but then the ways he hurts timber the most are completely thoughtless, like he hurts him worse when he isn't even trying, IT'S SO INTERESTING... I SHOULDN'T.. EVEN BE POSTING ABOUT IT YET but i can't contain myself... when can i make a new build???????? oh but it's all mature route stuff...... it's...... HGGGHHHG SO MUCH HAS HAPPENED, I'M AT 34K WORDS???? I HAVE EPILOGUES TO WRITE???????? THIS IS A FREE GAME?????????????? i think it's going to derail everyone's lives, no one can play this lightly.</p>

            <p>weeks. weeks of waking up every morning and thinking about timber. i get out of bed 5-6am and start working on the game right away and i can't stop until midnight. i'm compelled. he compels me. i'm so glad i finally got to share a build but now my problem is i finished the next route and i want people to play it but the one after it has more important stuff connected to that route that i want people to get to experience them together, UGH BUT NOW WHEN PEOPLE PLAY THE PREVIOUS BUILD IM LIKE "YOU DON'T KNOW THE HALF OF IT!! YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW!!!!!" like there's so much going on in this game it's--HAHA it'll be 30k words after today!!!! i'm getting there!!!!! 125 cgs????? no problem!!!!!! it's not even all of them, ive only drawn one of the nsfw ones!!!!! hahaha!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
            <p>sorry, i've gone absolutely feral writing this, i have a desperate need to express these emotions cuz working on the game is only making me feel stronger and i might explode. burnout is over, we're so back. i can do anything, i can make anything... timber.......... *clutches heart* you guys don't even know yet...!!!!!</p>
            <p>maybe once it's out i can openly gush about individual scenes but like thats just going to be me pointing at everything in the game and going HHGHGHGGHGGGGG but you should just play it, it'll be free, for the price of $0 you can never think about anything but timber again</p>
            <p>i'll open asks after it comes out.</p>

            <p>i think NOT getting to post games is suffering, i want to share my art as soon as it's done, i want to let my work evolve in front of people so they can watch it grow with me and we can go "OH MY GOD???????????" together</p>

            <p>i am writing/drawing <strong>the dark content</strong> for nwt now and my god this game is self indulgent. im like... OUGH... what if i always just make what i think is compelling and not worry about going too far. i wanna feel this intensely about every game i make. it's not even like i was particularly censoring myself before, it's more like i've unlocked new options...? games can be like this????? the rules were made up??????? i can make nwt and everyone loves it???????????? (thanks to the patrons who played and sent me their feelings)</p>
            
            <p>i think... the thing that held me back before with other games, is like trying to make them more and more polished and a solid "product" yknow, but indie games can be messy and fucked up, i can spend all day drawing with my pixel brushes and get so much art done instead of what happened with starry flowers where there was so much to draw and it took so long to color everything even though the result was amazing, i think it has intimidated me away from making the sequel, in my head it will take such a long time to finish but actually i can make a game really fast if i just let myself have fun with it</p>
            
            <p>ok in the starry flowers book 2 case in particular i needed syrup 2 to come out first, which, the story content i wanted people to know for sf2 is in the early access build, so i can actually make that game anytime now. i wanna keep the art style mostly but theres some parts i will be able to do something different with HEHEH i look forward to that...</p>
            
            <p>but first... im finishing timber game asap... then i think i can amp up to get some treat stuff done, i'm feeling the pull thanks to timber... thanks timber...! i love you timber!!!! *keeps hurting him* i love you so much!!!!!!!</p>

            <p>the fact that i am opening treat but just for NWT reference... i wish i had this kind of fervor to finish the rest of LWT, but that one's a marathon not a sprint... NWT is absolutely a sprint tho, im running down a hill and cannot stop. CAN I MAKE A PATRON BUILD THIS WEEKEND??? I MIGHT!!!!!</p>

            <p>there's a straight line from me drawing fenrich disgaea 4 as a girl in 2013 to the entirety of lonely wolf treat existing, and if you didn't know that, now you do</p>

            <p>the sheer amount of consequences that spilled out from "syrup and butterscotch should go to a snowy mountain to get a candy ingredient together, i guess wolves show up" → "treat's pack can't be the ones who randomly chase after people, i guess there's a different pack they split off from who are more hostile" → "what if i make an alternate ending where you meet that pack since otherwise the story will never touch on them"</p>
            <p>and now timber exists and i spend a month writing a game about him because one side chapter wasn't enough. everything is syrup's fault, that's why it should be called syrupverse (candyverse???) instead of namiverse</p>

                <p>to go off for a bit in response to BlueDogXL's comment, what i love about the bad ends is that you really can think for a second that they aren't real and can't hurt you, but all the lore stuff that is revealed in them is absolutely still a thing in the true ending. you just never find out about it. timber is still at large, the taxidermy wolves are still in the warren, senbei is still a dangerous fascist who brought his family here under the guise of "protecting rabbits" but is really there to profit off their hatred and pursue his own freak obsessions--haha wait that last part is only really hinted in the battle conversation isn't it??? hahaha!!!! don't worry, there's more on the way!!!!!!!</p>
                <p>i replayed bad end 1 earlier today because i was like, oh god i need to see it again after having established all this new timber canon, and it was like... SUCH A TREAT (sorry).... he has so many lines where im like YES AND THIS IS YOUR MOTIVATION FOR SAYING THAT AND IT'S GOING TO BECOME 100% CLEAR TO PEOPLE WHO PLAY NIGHT WITH TIMBER, NO ONE WILL BE LEFT GUESSING, I'LL SPELL IT OUT FOR EVERYONE!!! and tundra too, like her lines are so manipulative, i was so struck by her being like "yeah look what your mom did to my face, am i really the only one who seems dangerous???"" OUGH tundra plays such a small role in lwt but if you're clever you can tell she's why timber is like that...... it's almost like... rabbits killing her partner started a cycle of violence that continues to this day...... ouchie!! oof!!! the pain, i'm so fascinated!!!!!</p>

                <p>yesterday i was explaining some stuff about NWT to the people i live with and had to say that timber and senbei have never interacted in canon, they havent even met yet, which was making me lose it because HAHA THEY HAVE NOW!!!! OH AND IT'S BAD!!!!!! OH NO IT'S REALLY BAD!!!!!!!!!</p>
                
                <p>i made the first build today to send to a friend, i need to fill in some more art and write the last couple scenes that can be reached in these routes and then i can make the patron build HAHAHAHA oh my god it's getting close. there's no music whatsoever but you dont need it to feel the weight of what's going on in there.</p>
                
                <p>i had to.. write... nearly 24k words before i allowed myself to talk about the spoilers even a little...</p>

            <p>btw thanks for the encouraging comments, i look forward to the fan response once this game is released</p>

            <p>actually here's my problem, the tone of my works can range from "wholesome" to dark (comedy) to erotic and if you're in the audience for two of those things it probably mostly works out for you, but if youre only there for one thing i can imagine everything that's not that just feels annoying to read</p>
            <p>anyway timber game gets really fucked up and won't be for everyone, but i don't care, it's for ME, i already made my ultimate crowd pleasing game so now i get to go wild on niche stuff, i can afford to do that.</p>

            <p>at this point i don't remember why i started making timber game other than "haha i could do date timber for next april fools day", but it became so serious, i'm fast approaching 20k words (longer than BET and syrup 1)........ it has its hooks in me like nothing else, usually i can resist a project im excited about to focus on things im SUPPOSED to be finishing sooner, but i literally wake up at 6am and start writing/drawing and don't stop unless i'm physically pulled away, and i've been stuck in this state for weeks even through a trip out of town.</p>
            <p>BUT LIKE</p>
            <p>WHEN IT COMES OUT YOU'LL SEE WHY??? I HOPE YOU'LL SEE....</p>

            <p>i got hit by a car while riding my bike last monday (i'm fine, it was a pretty low-speed collision) but my freaking HIP HURTS and it only started being super painful today/yesterday, so it might be a bone bruise or something... luckily my lifestyle mostly consists of sitting at my desk and working on games, which does not cause me pain and in fact heals the soul</p>
            <p>no matter who may try to strike me down, i WILL finish timber game!!!!! i am DYING to post a build (perhaps literally????????)</p>

            <p>uhh, um, *sweating* do i advertise my nsfw patreon????? they still don't let nsfw creators sell individual posts on there (which, selling posts was the whole reason i made the damn thing) I ASSUME because patreon is having the same exact struggle against payment processors that itchio and steam are.</p>
            <p>anyway this is going to destroy everyone's first impression of the game maybe, but i shared <a target="_blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/scene-from-night-140323512">scene from night with timber (18+)</a> on there, so i'm posting to let people know that exists if they are curious. (i'm so embarrassed i might die, no one talk to me about it)</p>
            
            <p>LIKE.......... ok i have not felt this kind of passion since making starry flowers, which is how i know it will be good. definitely not for everyone but i'm obsessed. this game will be free btw because i can't sell it due to payment processors!!!!!!!! haha!!!!!!!!!! it's gonna have a big stupid "are you 18 or older" when you start up the game!!!!!! that's the best i can do!!!!!!!!!!! hahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! there's more i want to say about the content, but it'd be massive spoilers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! bye i guess!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

            <p>i have returned</p>
            <p>here is what i have to share:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>sandusky's gotta be the spider capitol of the world (or maybe ohio as a whole)</li>
                <li>I SAW LIKE 40 HAWKS!!! IT WAS INCREDIBLE!!!! (mostly on the highway, did you know a group of them is called a kettle because theyre flying over hot air to get extra lift??? i'm a hawk guy now, i actually saw one bald eagle too)</li>
                <li>i wrote ~3k words more for timber game on my phone during the trip cuz i was thinking about it basically the whole time, and all i want to do is keep writing it but i have to release syrup 1 and 2 on steam now</li>
                <li>release build for syrup 1 is uploaded to steam as of last night as soon as i got home lol, so it'll be available at noon pst</li>
            </ul>
            <p>ok i think that's all, please look forward to the game where timber ****s you--i mean, please look forward to syrup 2 demo tomorrow (that's the one i ought to be promoting anyway)</p>

            <p>a man possessed, i've written 6,000 words in the past 48 hours.</p>
            <p>tomorrow i leave on a short vacation. though my body may be elsewhere, my mind will remain in timber's clutches.</p>
            <p>uh, i did not do the things i was supposed to do before this trip (make the final syrup build, post ocs you can steal, PACK?? ANYTHING?????) but anyway, i wanted to make a post to say i will not be updating my site until probably the 30th (when syrup 1 comes out on steam.. oh no.) goodbye for now, also look forward to the syrup 2 demo on october 1st (life comes at you fast!!!!)</p>
